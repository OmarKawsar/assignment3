             The Bugatti La Voiture Noire is one of the most expensive cars ever sold, with a price tag of $19 million. This car was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 2019 and is a tribute to the Bugatti Type 57 SC Atlantic.<br>

             Your wedding car will arrive decorated in ribbons and bows, this dates back to the wedding couples friends and family decorating the marital bed with flowers and ribbons, Well-wishers would escort the couple to the wedding bed and they would leave once the newlyweds were in bed together, symbolising the importance of procreation. Thankfully, new couples do not have an audience, but the decorating of the wedding car is thought to stem from this ritual.

The ribbons & bows on the wedding car will predominantly be coloured white or ivory, but some couples like to run with the colour of their wedding theme, perhaps the groom’s tie or the bridesmaid’s dresses. The decoration of the car is included in the hire price of the vehicle. Here at Silverline we also like to lay an array of petals on the carpets of the wedding car.<br>
